Approximate Nonlinear dynamics for uSimMarine.

!!! ATTENTION! This particular file/commit uses normal conventions for
\theta. Specifically,
    * 0 degrees is along the X axis ("due East")
    * 90 degrees is along the Y axis
    * Right-hand rule

Mike Benjamin uses the marine coordinate frame for \theta:
    * 0 Degrees is due North
    * 90 Degrees is due East

Ranges of control inputs:

    * Thrust: [0,100]
    * Rudder: [-100,100]

Makes the following assumptions/approximations:

    * Assumes default thrust map
    * Smoothly approximates max() with logsumexp() and abs() with the following SE
    method:

    v = state(3);
    theta = state(4);

    thrust = 10*logsumexp([0,u(1)]/10,lse_param); % Softmax; No negative acceleration.
    rudder = u(2); % Range: [-100,100]

%     outvector = zeros(4,1);

    outvector(1,1) = v*cos(theta);
    outvector(2,1) = v*sin(theta);
%     outvector(3,1) = softminimum(amax, thrust*(1-turn_loss/100*softabs(rudder,softabs_param)));
    outvector(3,1) = thrust*(1-turn_loss/100*softabs(rudder,softabs_param));

%     outvector(4) = rudder*sign(rudder)*(1+(abs(thrust)+50)/50);
    outvector(4,1) = turn_rate/5000*u(1)*u(2);
